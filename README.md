ðŸ”’ Project Security Note

This e-commerce project is a static site built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. All product data is sourced from local, pre-built JSON files, and there are no external data sources, APIs, or user-generated content involved.

The only use of sessionStorage is to temporarily store clicked product data, which originates solely from these trusted local files. No user input or external scripts modify this data at any point.

While the use of innerHTML in dynamic page generation is generally flagged by security tools like Snyk for potential XSS risks, in this case it is safe because all injected content is fully controlled by the developer and not user-generated.

âœ… No external data
âœ… No user input injection
âœ… No third-party scripts

Therefore, this project does not have active XSS vulnerabilities in its current state.
